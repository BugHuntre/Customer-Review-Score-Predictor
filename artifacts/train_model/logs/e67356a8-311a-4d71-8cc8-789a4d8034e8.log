[2025-04-04 10:17:54 UTC] 2025/04/04 15:47:53 WARNING mlflow.utils.autologging_utils: Encountered unexpected error during sklearn autologging: Could not find experiment with ID 0

[2025-04-04 10:17:54 UTC] No materializer is registered for type <class 'sklearn.linear_model._base.LinearRegression'>, so the default Pickle materializer was used. Pickle is not production ready and should only be used for prototyping as the artifacts cannot be loaded when running with a different Python version. Please consider implementing a custom materializer for type <class 'sklearn.linear_model._base.LinearRegression'> according to the instructions at https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/handle-data-artifacts/handle-custom-data-types
